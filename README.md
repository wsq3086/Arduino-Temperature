Arduino-Temperature
===================

Lol why?

So, I made this project because I was bored during the weekend. I had just received my Arduino and I figured out that I needed a -sort of- thermostat so i decide to build one!

===================

How does it work

So, what it basically does is very simple the Arduino measures the temperature in my room and sends the measured temperature through the Node SerialPort library to a socket. Done.

===================
What did I use

- Arduino Uno 
- Breadboard 
- Node.JS 
- Socket.IO 
- Node serialport
